      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I am a student in DUs coding program. I have always been fascinated by computers and technology, so I cannot wait to 
        learn the tools I need to begin a career in tech. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am a Colorado native, born and raised in Denver. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to be outside in the sunshine! Hiking, walking the dogs, playing catch or frisbee - anything that lets me get some sun!
        When I'm not outside I love reading, painting, or making home decor crafts.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be a fullstack developer, either for a start up or established company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in a small suburb outside of Denver.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>When I was a kid I used to dream about working with computers. My family has been involved in tech for years, so I finally decided to 
        focus on my idea of personal fufillment when it comes to my work life.
